From all polarity predictions a sample of 75 cases is selected. The three algorithms (baseline, VADER, and text_blob)
are compared using the macro f1-score :

baseline : 0.28
VADER : 0.49
text_blob : 0.3

Although f1-scores are quite low, VADER is able to outperform the other approaches.
text_blob is mostly predicting neutral values and it seems it is not able to distinguish between positive and negative
